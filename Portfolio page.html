        <p>This is my professional portfolio containing selected labs and assessments to demonstrate skills developed through the 1 year conversion BSc Web Technologies and Programming Course at GMIT, Galway.  My journey on this course was not always smooth and I came across many difficult areas to navigate, which gave me an incredible impetus to keep learning and growing.</p>
		
		<p>This project involves the migration of projects covered during first and second semester. In some cases I have selected just a handful of projects and in other cases have listed all projects and assignments for a particular module, that I particularly enjoyed learning.</p> 
		
		<p>This project seeks to build a professional portfolio and will be shared on version control (Git Hub) with academic staff and any other collaborators, such as employers, etc. In order to navigate through this project, click on the links, which will then bring you to a page containing information about a particular module (assessment, etc).  The course was continuous assessment thoughout the entire year and every module was assessed in accordance with continuous assessment criteria.  Where a module was not completely passed at the end of each semester, there was an opportunity to repeat the failed assessment and to pass the modules. It is a requirement in order to get awarded the BSc Web Technologies & Programming that ALL modules are successfully passed.</p>

		<p> <h2>SEMESTER ONE </h2></P>
		<p><h3>Introduction to Web Programming</h3></p>
		</div>
		<p>The following is a selection of labs, assessments, exercises from Introduction to Web Programming in Semester One. I found the introduction to Web Programming very good and enjoyed it, and hadn't done web programming previously.  I started off tentatively and a little nervous, as it was all quite new to me but over the course of the year I got to very much feel comfortable with it and through practice have increased my skills greatly. The following are some of the contents covered, although the list is not exhaustive. </P>

		</div><p>The following were projects completed for above module.  This was a repeat Ionic mobile app assignment, carried over from Semester 1.  It was a calorie control app, requiring user to input calories for each meal (breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, supper) and the average calories (min/max) for each meal were calculated. This project used Ionic Framework and Angular JS.</p>

		<P> This module was concerned with databases and data technology.  Please click on module descriptor to view contents in this module - <a href="Database Project 7th Dec 2016/Module Descriptor.pdf">Module Descriptor</a>.  I undertook a comprehensive project designed to assess a student’s ability to design and construct a database that can be deployed on a commercial database management system (ie) Relational Management Database, using relational schemata. We were given a choice of 3 scenarios and I choose car_parts schemata - please click on link for full schemata of database (tables & relationships) <a href="Database Project 7th Dec 2016/car_parts schematic of database (tables & relationships).pdf">Car_parts Schematic of database</a><br>   It was a requirement of the project that business rules be developed and implemented, and Codd's rules demonstrated.  It was also designed to test knowledge of Attributes, Primary & Foreign keys, and testing this on my SQL database, as well as providing evidence of insert, update, delete functions in mySQL.</p>

		<p>The following are projects completed for above module, both are ionic mobile apps.  The first is a Single Online Reminder App, where the user inputs data for reminder, which stores it on JSONBLOB API and the user can update or delete it.  If the reminder isn't deleted it will remain on the app and if it is deleted it will be deleted from app and JSONBLOB API.  There are also two hidden fields (creation time and creation date), and both fields are recorded and shown on JSONBLOB API when the user saves a reminder. These projects used Ionic Framework and Angular JS.</p>
