        <p>This week we were required to download the zip file, open basic-example.html file in browser, review script tags and review the javascript file in folder and to make sure we understand what's going on with JQuery commands before commencing exercise. The exercise involved JQuery chaining. In this example we used .hide()and .fadeIn()chaining methods of passing an argument.</p>

		<p> We downloaded the zip file and noted that ready.html file contained a div with an id attribute. We were asked to create a javascript file which targets the id attribute and update its innerHTML property, so that a paragraph is included in the div element, and write javascript to complete this element. </p>
